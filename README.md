# Online Shop
This was my first big project during my first semester. The goal was to create a program resembling an online shop, without a real backend of course. It was the first time I implemented the possibility to save the state of the program. When I started learning programming and to create software I could not imagen a program without a GUI.
But since I did not know how to create a GUI in Java I implemented a way to display something like a UI inside the terminal. Back than I was really proud of my first quote unquote GUI application, even though the code and the architecture is a mess :D .
